## Testing

*Special thanks to [@mbrugger](https://github.com/mbrugger) for implementing the testing functionality, a long awaited feature.*

The integration tests provide a docker configuration for a SFTP and FTP server you can use to test the synchronization.
A folder in /tmp is mounted into the docker container which can be used to compare the result after running PHPloy.

### Executing tests

To get started with testing, please follow the steps below:

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
2. Start the test server
```
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:/vagrant/PHPloy$ ./tests/start_test_server.sh
```
3. run the tests
```
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:/vagrant/PHPloy$ vendor/bin/phpunit tests
PHPUnit 4.8.26 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.
...
Time: 2.32 seconds, Memory: 4.25MB
OK (3 tests, 4 assertions)
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:/vagrant/PHPloy$
```
4. Stop the sftp server
```
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:/vagrant/PHPloy$ ./tests/stop_test_server.sh
```

### Writing new tests
Basically each test should be structured in the following way
1. Prepare a test repository and phploy.ini configuration
2. Run PHPLoy
3. Verify the result of the execution by comparing the source folder with the synchronization result

```
public function testSyncAddedFileShouldSucceed($testHelper)
{
  $this->testHelper = new PHPLoyTestHelper($testHelper);
  $this->testHelper->givenRepositoryWithConfiguration();
  $this->whenFileIsAdded();
  $this->thenRepositoryIsSynchronizedSuccessfully();
}
```

### Parametrized testing SFTP and FTP

For testing FTP and SFTP at the same time tests can be parametrized. Take a look at the CommitFileTest.php:
```
class CommitFileTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
{
  public function provider()
  {
    return array(
      array('ftp'),
      array('sftp')
    );
  }

  protected $testHelper;
  /**
  * @dataProvider provider
  */
  public function testSyncAddedFileShouldSucceed($testType)
  {
    $this->testHelper = new PHPLoyTestHelper($testHelper);
    // implement the test here
  }
}
```
The PHPLoyTestHelper is parametrized to provide different configurations based on the type passed to the test method by the PHPunit framework.
This is especially helpful if you want to test shared functionality available for multiple protocols.
